But a  library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is devided up in sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person don't like it dont mean someone else dosn't.      Librarys don't make people look at or check out something they don't like. so why are people complaining about it. They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes over due. So people stop complainging about what the library has on there shelves.",2,10,persuasive,"""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.

3836,2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.",4,10,persuasive,"""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.

3291,2,"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.",5,10,persuasive,"""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.
