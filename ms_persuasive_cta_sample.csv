1699,1,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on peoples' lives. You can do alot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people. In conclusion computers are very convinient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people",8,8,persuasive,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects computers have onpeople. Persuade the readers to agree with you.",low
333,1,"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of affects on people. Some affects are it takes away from family and friends, you don't really have a social life and you don't get enough excersise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1; and I asked,"" @CAPS1 you go over your grandmas house what do you usually do?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I usually use the computer."" @CAPS3 do you want to use the computer while your their? your with your family your supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great way to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games bring them! People think that because there is facebook, aim, e-mail, and myspace that your interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things and @CAPS2 said ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer your not really maintaing a social life. Your town holds activites or has a fun place you could too. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go their and hangout with friends interact with them. Go to school, goto the library, and hang out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 your sititng in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While your sitting in the chair your not excercising, @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5 your gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 your stuffing your face wih cheez- itz and not excersising I asked @PERSON2 a question it was what do you do while your on the computer? @CAPS2 said ""I eat.."" @CAPS5 isn't bad, but @CAPS1 your not really paying attention you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leaguges of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get @CAPS7! Computers aren't the greastest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up, and be mature for the future.",9,8,persuasive,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

659,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.",10,8,persuasive,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.
